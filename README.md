# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template the BackEnd is made in Node.js using Sequelize, JWT, and Bcrypt.

## Description

I'm so excited to share with you the technologies and platforms I used in this project! Firstly, we leveraged Postman, which made it incredibly easy to test our API and ensure its reliability. Then, we implemented Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage our application state efficiently and effectively. To build our frontend, we utilized Create React App, which allowed us to quickly bootstrap our project and get up and running in no time. And of course, we can't forget about Node.js - a powerful server-side programming platform that lets us develop applications using JavaScript. With Sequelize, an ORM library, we can seamlessly interact with relational databases. To ensure security, we implemented JWT, a JSON Web Token standard for access tokens used in web applications, and used Bcrypt to securely hash and store passwords. These tools and platforms made this project a success and allowed us to deliver a reliable and secure application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
